## Hydration Mitosis

This is an experiment that uses the [Mitosis](https://github.com/BuilderIO/mitosis) compiler to create blocks using
the Mitosis syntax and compile them to both React (for frontend) and a Liquid
template to be rendered on the server in PHP.

## How does it work

## Usage

1. Clone this project inside your `wp-content/plugins` directory.

2. `npm start`.

3. `npm run compile` - This will compile the component in `src/shared-block` to both
   React and a Liquid template.

Compiling to react is currently a bit broken.

Mitosis syntax is meh
